#### Helpful suggestion

1. I would also recommend for you to just look at the finished applications and try to replicate each one of them without looking at the code, give it your best shot, if you find any problems then take a quick glance at the code to see where it got kind of confusing. some of the applications requires a bit of setup with third party libraries like redux and firebase, you might want to learn a bit about those before attempting to build the applications without looking at the code.

2. feel free to add new features to projects or add more projects with smiliar level of difficulty and i will be happy to review your code and give you some helpful comments.

3. Drink coffee!
